## Technical Implementation

### **Components**
- **Main Component**: `SupplierEditForm.tsx`
- **Location**: `src/features/suppliers/components/SupplierEditForm.tsx`
- **Integration**: Added to `SupplierProfilePage.tsx`

### **Dependencies**
- React functional component with hooks
- Form validation using existing validation utilities
- Notification system integration
- Consistent styling with AddSupplierForm

### **State Management**
- Local form state management
- Change tracking with `hasChanges` state
- Error state management for validation
- Loading state management for save operations

### **Data Flow**
1. Supplier data passed as prop to SupplierEditForm
2. Form initializes with supplier data
3. User makes changes (tracked by hasChanges)
4. Form validation on submit
5. Save operation calls parent handler
6. Parent updates supplier state
7. Success/error notifications displayed

## Usage Instructions

### **Accessing the Edit Tab**
1. Navigate to any supplier profile page (`/suppliers/:id/profile`)
2. Click on the "Edit Supplier" tab (2nd tab)

4. Or click "Cancel" to discard changes

### **Form Validation**
- Required fields are marked with red asterisk (*)

### **Save Handler**
- `handleSupplierSave` function in SupplierProfilePage

### **Navigation**
